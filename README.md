## Udacity: Landing Page Project
In this project, I used JavaScript to navigate through the DOM and dynamically build the navigation menu, include smooth scroll behaviour to allow sections to fit nicely to the viewport and applied Intersection Observer to set and style the active state.

## Features

- Dynamic Navigation
- Section Active State
- Scroll to Anchor
- Responsive Web Design
